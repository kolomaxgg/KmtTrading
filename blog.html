          <h3>From Waiter to Full-Time Trader: François Laforest’s $5K Monthly Journey</h3>
          <div class="expandable">
            <p>François Laforest spent years working long shifts in a busy Montreal restaurant, barely making ends meet. After hearing about KMT’s Forex trading course from a friend, he decided to give it a try — dedicating two hours every evening to study and practice after work.</p>
            <p>He started with demo trading, learning how to read charts and manage risk under the guidance of KMT’s mentorship program. Within months, his confidence grew, and he transitioned to a live account with a small investment. Mistakes were made along the way, but he stayed consistent and learned from every loss.</p>
            <p>One year later, François now earns around $5,000 monthly trading Forex full-time. He says his biggest gain wasn’t financial — it was the discipline, focus, and mindset that transformed how he approaches both trading and life.</p>

          <h3>How Sarah Dufour Turned $500 Into $10K With Crypto Signals</h3>
          <div class="expandable">
            <p>Sarah Dufour, a young professional from Laval, started trading crypto while working as a full-time graphic designer. She discovered KMT’s free Telegram group and decided to follow the Bitcoin and Ethereum setups with just a $500 starting budget.</p>
            <p>She took things slow — logging every trade, tracking her results, and refining her entries using technical analysis lessons from KMT mentors. Over time, she learned to let profitable trades run and cut losses early, mastering emotional control.</p>
            <p>After 12 months of disciplined growth, Sarah’s portfolio reached $10,000, and today she manages over $50K while working remotely. She credits her success to mentorship, patience, and risk management — not luck. “Trading gave me freedom, but it took consistency to get there,” she says.</p>

      <!-- MOHAMED KHALIDI – Ville Saint-Laurent -->

          <h3>Mohamed Khalidi’s Journey From Accounting Student to Confident Trader</h3>
          <div class="expandable">
            <p>Mohamed Khalidi, originally from Ville Saint-Laurent, was studying accounting at university when he first became interested in trading. Balancing classes, part-time work, and his studies made learning Forex seem nearly impossible — until he joined KMT’s mentorship program.</p>
            <p>Mohamed started by mastering the basics: support and resistance, trend identification, and risk-reward ratios. His mentors helped him structure a clear trading plan, and he began practicing daily on demo accounts before going live. Within six months, he was earning consistent small profits.</p>
            <p>Today, Mohamed trades both Forex and crypto while finishing his degree. His dream is to open a small trading firm in Montreal to help other students learn financial independence. “KMT gave me the structure I needed — I just had to put in the effort,” he says proudly.</p>
